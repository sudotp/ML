Cell 1 – Import Libraries
Imports all necessary libraries:
numpy, pandas → for data handling and numerical operations.
train_test_split → to split data into training and testing sets.
KNeighborsClassifier → implements KNN algorithm.
metrics → for model evaluation.
seaborn → for data visualization.


Cell 2 – Load Dataset
Loads the diabetes.csv dataset into a DataFrame named data.
This dataset contains health parameters of patients and a target column “Outcome” indicating whether they are diabetic (1) or not (0).

Cell 3 – Display Dataset
Displays the first 5 rows of the dataset to verify data loading and understand feature structure.


Cell 4 – Check for Missing Values
Checks for null (missing) values in each column.
This ensures the dataset is clean or helps identify if imputation is needed.


Cell 5 – Replace Zero Values with Mean
Replaces invalid zero values (which mean missing data) in medical features with the mean value of each column.
This step improves model accuracy and ensures clean data for training.


Cell 6 – Define Features and Target
Defines X = independent input features (like Glucose, BMI, etc.).
Defines Y = target output variable (Outcome: 1 → diabetic, 0 → non-diabetic).


Cell 7 – Split Data
Splits dataset into:
80% training data (for model learning)
20% testing data (for performance evaluation)
random_state=0 ensures reproducibility.


Cell 8 – Outlier Detection
Visualizes outliers using boxplots.
Calculates IQR (Interquartile Range) to detect data points lying beyond 1.5 × IQR.
Displays count of outliers per feature.
Outlier detection helps understand noisy data.


Cell 9 – Initialize KNN Model
Creates a KNN classifier with k=5 neighbors and trains it on the training data.
The model learns patterns by comparing feature distances among nearby data points.


Cell 10 – Make Predictions
Predicts the Outcome (0 or 1) for test samples using the trained KNN model.


Cell 11 – Calculate Metrics
Computes all evaluation metrics:
Confusion Matrix → shows correct vs incorrect predictions.
Accuracy → overall correct predictions ratio.
Error Rate → incorrect prediction ratio.
Precision, Recall, F1-score → advanced metrics for model quality.


Cell 12 – Display Results
Displays performance metrics for easy interpretation.
Helps evaluate how well KNN performs on the diabetes dataset.


Cell 13 – Test Different K Values
Tests different values of K (3, 5, 7) to see which gives the best accuracy.
Plots accuracy vs K-value curve for visual comparison.
Helps determine the optimal K value for the dataset.
