K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm used to group data into K clusters based on feature similarity.
It works by randomly initializing K centroids and assigning each data point to the nearest centroid. Then the centroids are recomputed as the mean of all assigned points, and this process repeats until convergence.
The Elbow Method is used to find the optimal number of clusters by plotting inertia (within-cluster sum of squares) versus K. The point where the decrease in inertia becomes less steep (the “elbow”) represents the ideal number of clusters.


Cell 1 – Import Libraries -

Imported all required libraries.
pandas, numpy → data handling.
matplotlib, seaborn → plotting graphs.
KMeans → to apply K-Means clustering.
StandardScaler → to normalize numerical features for better clustering.


Cell 2 – Load Dataset
Loaded dataset into a DataFrame.
encoding='latin1' avoids text encoding errors.
head() shows first 5 rows to verify correct loading.


Cell 3 – Preprocessing
Selected only numeric columns for clustering (K-Means works only on numbers).
Removed missing values using dropna().
Used StandardScaler to scale features — gives equal weight to all attributes.


Cell 4 – Elbow Method (Find Best K)
The Elbow Method helps choose the best number of clusters.
inertia measures how close points are to their cluster center.
The “elbow point” on the graph shows the optimal K (where curve bends).
Usually, k=3 or k=4 is found optimal.


Cell 5 – Apply K-Means
Created K-Means model with 3 clusters (from Elbow result).
.fit() trains the model.
Added a new column Cluster to store which cluster each record belongs to.


Cell 6 – Visualization
Plotted a scatter plot using SALES and QUANTITYORDERED.
Different colors show different clusters.
Helps visualize how customers/products are grouped based on sales patterns.



ALGORITHM - 
Load and preprocess the dataset.
Select only numeric columns and normalize the data.
Use the Elbow Method to find the optimal K value.
Apply the K-Means algorithm with that K.
Assign each record to its cluster.
Visualize clusters using scatter plot.
