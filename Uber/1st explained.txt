Cell 1 — Importing Libraries

We import all the required Python libraries:

pandas → for handling and cleaning dataset
numpy → for mathematical calculations
matplotlib & seaborn → for plotting graphs
sklearn → for machine learning models (Linear & Random Forest) and evaluation metrics


Cell 2 — Load Dataset - 
The dataset is loaded using read_csv() function to analyze the structure, column names, and data types.


Cell 3 — Dataset Info and Summary - 
info() shows data types and missing values
describe() gives statistical details like mean, min, max, etc.


Cell 4 — Pre-processing the Dataset
We remove:
Missing values → using dropna()
Duplicate entries → using drop_duplicates()


Cell 5 — Identify Outliers
Outliers are the extreme values that differ greatly from the rest of the data.
They can affect model performance and accuracy.

In this step, a boxplot is used to visualize outliers, and the IQR method (Interquartile Range) is applied to remove them.
Formula used:
IQR = Q3 - Q1
Records lying outside [Q1 - 1.5×IQR, Q3 + 1.5×IQR] are treated as outliers and removed.



Cell 6 — Correlation
The correlation matrix shows how numerical variables are related to each other.
It helps identify which features have a strong positive or negative impact on the target (fare_amount).
numeric_only=True ensures only numeric columns are used.
Values close to +1 = strong positive relation, −1 = strong negative relation, 0 = no relation.



Cell 7 — Split Data
X contains all numeric input features (independent variables).
y is the target variable (fare_amount).
train_test_split() divides data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
random_state=42 ensures reproducibility.


Cell 8 — Linear Regression
Linear Regression is used to predict continuous values (like fare amount).
The model is trained using fit() and predictions are made with predict().
Performance is measured using:
R² Score: how well the model fits (closer to 1 = better)
RMSE: average prediction error (lower = better)


Cell 9 — Random Forest Regression
Random Forest is an ensemble method using multiple decision trees.
Each tree gives a prediction, and the average is taken as the final output.
It usually gives higher accuracy than Linear Regression.
Here, n_estimators=10 keeps runtime short for practical demo.


Cell 10 — Model Comparison
Compares both models based on R² score.
Higher R² indicates a better model performance.
This helps decide which algorithm fits the dataset better.
